# Python Plant Leaves Classifier

This python program classifies plant leaves according to several attributes. The goal is to locate the plant leaf in a predefined species, according to the input parameters.

It uses the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm from python's scikit-learn library. At the end of the execution, the user will get the classification of the leaf as well as an image of a similar leaf, according to the species.

## Requisites
You will need to install Python along with the following libraries:
* Python
* Pillow
* Matplotlib
* Numpy
* Scikit-learn
* Scipy

## Steps
* Clone the repository
* Open a terminal in the repository's location in your computer
* Run the program with the following command:
```python main.py```
